# Local staging environment workspace

## Introduction

This workspace allows you locally launch the equivalent of remote staging environment instances
(applications, databases, etc.), within the [GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/) paradigm.

This workspace provides scripts for injecting and initializing a database with demo data,
or for copying the contents of remote instances to the local database.

This workspace is the right place if you want to work (fix bug, improveâ€¦) in
isolation (without disturbing your colleagues) on staging-type configuration changes.

This workspace is also useful for tinkering to better understand how this environment works.
